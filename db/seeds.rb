#HiiiPower - Kendrick Lamar
l1 = "[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar-coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation, (dread) that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the Devil's working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license
to kill, I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Trying to be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Alori Joh (Kendrick Lamar)]
Every day we fight the system
just to make our way, we been down for too long
But that's alright, we was built to be strong
cause it's our life, na-na-nah
Every day we fight the system
We fight the system
We fight the system
(Never liked the system)
We been down for too long
But that's alright, na-na-nah

[Kendrick Lamar]
Who said a black man in Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
on the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
loaded that clip and then said Bang!, the drama it bring
is crazy, product of the late 80s
Trying to stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Kendrick Lamar]
Thug life
Thug LIFE!"

#The Recipe - Kendrick Lamar
l2 = "[Dr Dre:]
Every morning when I wake up
Uh, money on my mind
Good times and get caked up
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I'm living but
Really though, it's never enough
10 million, that's a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for...

[Hook:]
Women, weed and weather
They come for
Women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the
Women, weed and weather
Women, weed and weather

These niggas'll kill for that
Put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that
Me, I make mills off that
How the fuck ya'll can't see I ride
When I drive, down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes
I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day I guess
For a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby gonna lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

[Hook:]
Women, weed and weather
They come for
Women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the
Women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Yo, it sound clever, come and play
Wha-Wha-what more can I say
Welcome to LA

[Kendrick Lamar:]
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
3W's only for a three day run
Bitch, take the motherfacking panties off you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breath
I control, California living til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe cause she in the neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy, and for my niggas OG Killa
Call it Jason Vorhees, boy he,
On his job, boy he sure be havin' them marks on they marks
Pretty bitches and tyre marks
Let 'em inhale the pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost
For this life controlling my price
No way hell no, uh uh
If I'm wrong than I wanna be right
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault that it's 82 degrees
And my top peeled off

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

[Hook]

[Dr Dre:]
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees
Double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, motherfuck your opinion
How many ways am I killin' 'em
Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck til the morning
Time and I got time and I know that I'm in a position of controlling anything
I buy that ocean, I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean
Ain't nobody fucking with this

[Kendrick Lamar:]
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em but in between, my time
I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean towards 3 W's and life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don't fuck with' no hand me downs
See if you fuck than it's after me
You know how much I'm a make it work?
You know her dress, living in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first
Cali

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

#Return of Simba - J.Cole
l3 = "In my freshest Js, I ain’t slept in days
Girl, you gon’ make me late undressin’ me
Know you ain’t seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
‘Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, “Is you ready for it?”
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, “Nigga, you already know it”

Bitch, I’m the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch (Yeah)
Bitch, I’m the man of the year

What you ‘sposed to do when the OG niggas don’t get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won’t quit it
Homie, it’s a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don’t got a fuckin’ clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler’s still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin’ a killin’ off me
Red diamonds he designin’ got me shinin’
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blindin’
A cop light runner, they wanna but can’t find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was livin’, said “I gotta get my weight up”
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed wit’ my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, “Look, my niggas, we got a foot in”
Bein’ good is good, that’ll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin’
Can’t guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you’ll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my ’90s niggas is gon’ get it
18 and under, that’s prolly gon’ take a minute
I’ma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
I’ma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, five years ’til I know thirty
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, ’cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin’ jumpin’ jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin’ laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin’ strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, ’cause no father figure
Means you don’t got a nigga comin’ ’round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin’ home these rotten niggas
Blowin’ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo’
To give the young niggas somethin’ they could reach fo’
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I’m a li’l more realer
When it come from the heart, don’t it feel mo’ iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I’m a li’l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y’all gon’ have to pardon me
They say I rep that ‘Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It’s flowin’ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I’m varsity
No field trip, ain’t hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit’ yo’ bitch in it, and listen it, was starrin’ me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter that Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I’d fail
It’s Judgment Day, I’m here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
Wit’ dessert to take, wit’ dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin’ over
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I’m ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin’ my prime
‘Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds..)"

#Beggin' - Logic
l4 = "[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm a get it right now and never will I give up
Homie this is food for thought you better fill up
I'm coming in strong with a song for very long
So I gotta make you understand before the beat is gone
Homie you are not alone, we are in the zone
We are in the matrix full of that fake shit
Make you wanna grab the gat and go ape shit
Living in a world of lies I can't take it
Needed someone to save me, Needed someone to hug me
Needed a whole world but nobody would love me
'Had I learned from this that people wanna buck me
Had I learned from this that people wanna buck me'
I said I can't take it I know I'm gonna make it
I know I'm not normal but I gotta fake it
I swear I'm not cocky, I am just confident
That when I step On the stage I am dominant and now I am beggin

[Hook:]
Beggin, Beggin You
Put yo' Loving Hand Out baby
Beggin, Beggin You
Put yo' Loving Hand Out Darling

[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]
Sick of living in the dark so I'm begging for the light
Feeling like I'm in a fight every single time a write
Cus I gotta make sure that they hear me right
Told me that I couldn't do it so when I pick up the mic
I gotta kill it with something so real that when they hear it
They can feel what's in my soul
Lyrical cocaine yeah homie I got a blow
But first they gotta know who I is
So I'm begging for recognition on the mission just to do it big
Cus I ain't new to this I'm true to this
Thinking I'm a stand up and roll out Homie that's ludacris
Not here to play no games, I'm here to stay and make a change
And mate your ways so I remain
I'm in the studio for days and days
Spittin' out these razorblades, don't wanna place no blame
But without you I couldn't get to where I'm headding
So to everybody I'm begging

[Hook:]
Beggin, Beggin You
Put yo' Loving Hand Out baby
Beggin, Beggin You
Put yo' Loving Hand Out Darling

[Verse 3: Logic]
Yeah, Yeah, I said this is my path don't mess with me
I didn't choose this life it was destiny
God tested me to find the best of me
And I know I'm going to make it even without a degree
Cus the test scores don't mean shit to me
And when you said that I would fail it didn't get to me
Now I'm begging, public masses, please
I'm way to proud to get down on my knees
But I'm begging, on another level
Fuck Illuminati that's word to the devil
Cus I am not about that I just wanna love
I just wanna grow, I just wanna learn
The pass and the verbs to write this music
I'm so late that I just might lose it
But don't ever confuse it, it's all so worth it
I just wanna help it but not hurt it
And as for my style I don't know how to word it
Why do you even have to catergorize me?
Fuckin' let em hate, let 'em all despise me
Cus I'm gonna take this, fill it up and make this
Something that the whole word cannot imagine
Let alone fathom I'm from another planet
I swear I'm not mathic, listen to me dammit
My future's in your hands and so I'm beggin

[Hook: x2]
Beggin, Beggin You
Put yo' Loving Hand Out baby
Beggin, Beggin You
Put yo' Loving Hand Out Darling"
